<h1>📊📈 Supply Chain Dashboard</h1>

## 👋 Hi there!

<h2> 📝 Project Overview</h2>

For this project, we created a real-time dashboard and communication app aimed at enhancing visibility and communication within the supply chain and sales teams. The project addresses the limitations of Excel by providing a scalable, automated solution that integrates directly with Oracle EBS and PowerApps.

<h2>⚙️ Problem Statement</h2>

The existing system relied heavily on Excel, which limited scalability and lacked automation. This resulted in delays and inefficiencies, especially in tracking key metrics like Excess Quantity and Near Expiry Stock. Additionally, communication between the sales and supply chain teams needed to be more streamlined.

<h2>🛠️ Solution</h2>

We implemented a Power BI dashboard linked to Oracle EBS, providing real-time updates for critical metrics. Additionally, a PowerApps-based communication app was developed, enabling the sales team to stay informed on inventory levels and stock statuses, all while keeping the Supply Chain Director in the loop.

<h2> 🔧 Technologies Used </h2>

- 📊 Power BI: For visualization and dashboard creation.
  
- 🔗 Oracle EBS: Primary data source, with data modeling done in Oracle, then pushed to Power BI.
  
- 📐 DAX: Used in Power BI for creating custom metrics and calculations.
  
- 📱 PowerApps: Developed a mobile-friendly app for the sales team, enabling real-time communication and updates.
  
<h2>🚀 Key Features</h2>

- Real-Time Data Integration
  
  Automated data updates from Oracle EBS to Power BI, eliminating manual Excel updates.

- Historical Sales History and Customers data

- Excess Quantity & Near Expiry Tracking

  Easy access to essential inventory metrics for proactive decision-making.

- Sales Team Communication App

  A dedicated PowerApps app that provides the sales team with instant updates, streamlining communication with the supply chain team.

<h2> ✅ Outcome </h2>

The dashboard and app have optimized supply chain operations and sales team responsiveness, significantly improving workflow efficiency. Real-time insights, automated updates, and an intuitive design allow the team to make proactive decisions with ease.

<h2> 💡 Future Improvements </h2>

- Demand Forecasting:
An exciting enhancement planned for the dashboard is the addition of forecasting capabilities to predict stock levels.
